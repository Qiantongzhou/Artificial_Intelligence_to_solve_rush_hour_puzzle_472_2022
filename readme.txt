2. Greedy Best First Search (GBFS)
3. Algorithm A or A⋆(A/A⋆)



file content:
main script: 472_a2_final.ipynb, question2_50_examples/472_a2_50.ipynb
Analysis of result: Analysis.pdf
for demo: 472-Slides-#-#.pdf

for output content: 
question2_50_examples
question1_5_examples


output file name style:
(search algorithm)_(file type)_(^algorthm heuristics)_(puzzle number).txt
	example: Astar_search_h1_1.txt



how to use script:
472_a2_final.ipynb can read sample-input.txt and output first 6 rush hour with 3 alogrithms.
question2_50_examples/472_a2_50.ipynb can read sample-input.txt and output all rush hour with 3 alogrithms. 

	caution:
	input file style is different for two script
		472_a2_final.ipynb use AA as car and . as empty
		question2_50_examples/472_a2_50.ipynb use XX as car and - as empty
